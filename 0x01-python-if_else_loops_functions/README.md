# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, which is the second project I am working on in the higher level programming journey, so I started to utilize conditionals and loops in Python by using "if", "if ... else", "break", "continue", "pass", and "range" statements along with "while" and "for" loops. In addition,
I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about some important concepts such as, scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
