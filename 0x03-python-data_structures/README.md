# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, which is the fourth project of the higher level programming journey, I learned about Data Structures like Lists and Tuples.
Lists: Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written 
as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. 
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
Tuples: Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to 
store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. 
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
